- (Check) Make Problem feed on home page. Only other users' Problems should be shown and clickable (to Vote -> insert Vote in database).

- (Check) Create Problem. Form for user.
	- (Check) Create form for Problem Solutions.

- Create relationships with Skills table. Users have Skills, Problems require Skills.

- Create view of Votes per Problem. In nice chart or pie graph. Or both. ;-)

- Create Problem only accessible after n Votes have been cast. Make nice countdown in sidebar ('n Votes left until you can create a new Problem')

- Create 'Viewed' table. Don't let a user see the same problem twice.

- Implement Helpfulness: users can mark Votes as Helpful. Most Helpful users are mentioned on home page (Top 10-ish).
